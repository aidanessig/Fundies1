; == Homework 4, Problem 2 ==

; Consider the following data definition:

(define-struct processing [estimate])
(define-struct shipped [estimate])

; An estimate is a string
; Interpretation: represents the date associated with an item

; estimate-temp : estimate -> ?
(define (estimate-temp e)
  (... e ...))

; A PackageStatus is one of:
; - (make-processing String)
; - (make-shipped String)
; - "on the truck"
; - #true
; Interpretation: status of a package delivery,
; either processing (i.e., not yet shipped) with
; an expected ship date, already shipped with
; an expected delivery date, on the truck for
; delivery today, or already delivered (#true)

(define PackageStatus-1 (make-processing "9/22/2020"))
(define PackageStatus-2 (make-shipped "12/20/2021"))
(define PackageStatus-3 "on the truck")
(define PackageStatus-4 #true)

; PackageStatus-temp : PackageStatus -> ?
(define (PackageStatus-temp ps)
  (cond
    [(string=? "on the truck" ps) ...]
    [(boolean=? #true ps) ...]
    [(processing? ps) (... processing-estimate ps ...)]
    [(shipped? ps) (... shipped-estimate ps ...)]))
         
; TODO #1: finish the data design recipe for PackageStatus

; TODO #2: design the function package-update,
; which given a package label (e.g., "my new ipad"),
; number of items in the shipment (e.g., 1), and
; PackageStatus, and outputs a status update.

; Some example status updates include:
; - "my new ipad (1 item) is still processing and should ship on 3/14/2021"
; - "newest HP spinoff (2 items) has shipped and should arrive on 10/19/2020"
; - "tasty cookies (4 items) is on the truck for delivery today"
; - "red stapler (1 item) has been delivered"

; Hint: if you find that the right-hand side of your cond
; branches repeat a lot of the same work, you should move
; some of that work out of the cond (possibly into helper
; functions) so your code doesnâ€™t repeat itself.

; label-temp : label -> ?

; An items is an integer
; Interpretation: represents the number of items in an order

; items-temp : items ->
(define (items-temp i)
  (... i ...))

; package-update : label items PackageStatus -> String
; Interpretation: outputs a status update relative to
; the inputs
