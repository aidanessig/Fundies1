; - lambda
; - multiple inputs
; - trees
; - list abstraction

; graphs
; - there are no directions such as in trees
; - undireted / non-linear

; local
; - use a local if there is a struct with data
;   that needs to be accessed
; - same rule applies for helper functions

; lambda
; - if it is needed only one time
