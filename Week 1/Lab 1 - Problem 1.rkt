; For any word of at least one character that starts with a letter,
; letâ€™s say that its "bingo word" is the uppercase version of the
; first letter, followed by a space, and then followed by the number
; of characters in the word. For example, the bingo word of "bingo"
; is "B 5" and the bingo word of "Win" is "W 3".

; TODO: Write a function, bingo-word, that takes a string as an argument
; and returns its bingo word. You may assume that the argument is a valid
; word as described above.

; Don't forget to include a signature and reasonable purpose statement.

; bingo -> "B 5"

; bingo-word : string -> string
; takes a word and returns first letter capitalized
; and the length

(define (bingo-word word)
  (string-append
   (string-upcase (substring word 0 1))
   " "
   (number->string(string-length word))))
