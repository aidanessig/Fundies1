; Consider the function tosh defined below.
; (For functions used by tosh that arenâ€™t familiar,
; look them up in the DrRacket documentation.)


; tosh : String NonNegInteger -> NonNegInteger

(define (tosh e f)
  (max ; returns the greater number between length of e and first number of f
   (string-length e) ; returns the length of e
   (string->number ; converts this number to a string
    (substring ; returns first number 5 -> 5 , 78 -> 7
     (number->string ; converts number to string
      (floor ; returns the greatest integer less than or equal to x
       (abs f))) ; returns absolute value of f
     0 1))))

; TODO: replace "SIGNATURE HERE" with a signature for the function tosh
; (Since this code is nonsense, do not provide a purpose statement)

; TODO: confirm your signature by defining two constants below...
; 1. Define ACTUAL-OUTPUT to be the result of calling tosh on your choice of inputs
; 2. Define EXPECTED-OUTPUT to be the result you expect to be produced by calling
;    tosh on the inputs you chose for #1.
;

(define ACTUAL-OUTPUT (tosh "hello" 2))
(define EXPECTED-OUTPUT 5)

; You should run your code to ensure that these two constants have the same value.
