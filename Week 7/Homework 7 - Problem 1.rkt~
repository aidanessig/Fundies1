; For each TODO below, refer to the following data definition,
; and use pre-defined list abstraction(s) when appropriate.

; Note #1: part of the credit for each problem will be the choice
; of abstraction(s), so make sure they are a good match and lead
; to an effective function design!

; Note #2: just because we now have cool abstractions doesn't mean
; you should forget about the design recipe and following templates
; (which particularly come up for abstraction helpers)!

; any of the publications are "old", which we'll define as
; having been published before 2015 - in computing research,
; that's basically a million years ;)



; TODO #6: design the function title-pyramid that accepts a

; authors (including duplicates, if there are any). The list
; should be sorted alphabetically (as the names appear; so,
; for example, "Amit Shesh" comes before "Andrea Danyluk").



; TODO #8: research papers often have a page limit and it
; is important that authors remember to save space at the
; end of their paper for a bibliography (a list of all the
; prior work they refer to in the paper); you are to design
; the function citation-space to help them. This function
; accepts a number (representing how many references they
; expect they'll need) and then produces text they can
; temporarily copy into their paper as a space saver - here
; is an example if they want to save space for 2 references...

; The [#]'s should start at 1 and increase to the number
; supplied to the function; each should have literally the
; text shown above (re: author, title, venue, and year/page
; information; and there should be a newline ("\n") between
; each line of the result (though not after the last line).

; (Note: if you'd like to see the effect of \n, just
; use the text function on the example above.)
