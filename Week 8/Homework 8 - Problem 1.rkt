; TODO #1: design the function my-email-style that facilitates personalizing
; messages based on a supplied opening word (such as Dear or Hi), punctuation
; used after the recipient's name (such as , or :), as well as a close for
; the message (such as -BW, which means best wishes, or Thanks!).
; For clarity, some tests have been supplied.
